# DALL-E OpenAI Back-end Template
This repo serves as a simple back-end NodeJS template that generates images using OpenAI's DALL-E system. There's also a straightforward front-end included to more easily test making requests to the OpenAI API.

## Installation & Usage

1. `npm install`
2. Create .env file
3. Create .env variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` that holds your unique OpenAI API secret. (You can create or find your secret at `https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys`)
4. `npm start` or `node index.js`

## Lessons Learned:

More than anything, this project was intended so that I could have a template I can quickly manipulate to fit larger full-stack applications that employ the OpenAI API. 

However, I did learn that despite the complexity of OpenAI's platforms and programs, they can easily be interfaced with through simple endpoint-guided APIs. Anyone new to APIs in general should have an easy time manipulating this template to fit their needs should they wish to utilize the OpenAI API.
